# Requirements Directory

This directory centralizes all requirements for the example projects in this repository. Each example has its own subdirectory containing specific requirements documentation.

## Purpose

- Provide a centralized location for all requirements across different examples
- Ensure consistent documentation of requirements across projects
- Track changes to requirements over time
- Facilitate easier understanding of project objectives and constraints

## Structure

- `01-market-practice/` - Requirements for the first market practice example
- `02-market-practice/` - Requirements for the second market practice example
- `03-market-practice/` - Requirements for the third market practice example
- `template.md` - Template for creating new requirement documents

## Usage

When starting a new example project:

1. Copy the `template.md` file to the appropriate subdirectory
2. Rename it to `requirements.md` or a more specific name if needed
3. Fill in the requirements based on the project needs

## Relationship to Implementation

Each requirements document should be linked from the corresponding example's README.md file for easy reference.

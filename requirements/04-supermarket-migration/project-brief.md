# SuperMarket Cloud Migration - Project Brief

## Project Scope & Deliverables

**What I WILL deliver:**
I will design and implement a modern AWS-native e-commerce infrastructure using AWS CDK that replaces SuperMarket's failing on-premise setup. The solution will include containerized web applications on ECS Fargate, managed MySQL database with RDS, Redis caching via ElastiCache, product search with OpenSearch, and load balancing with ALB - all deployed within a secure VPC architecture. I will demonstrate the working infrastructure through a functional deployment and present the business case through a structured technical proposal and executive presentation.

**What I will demonstrate in the prototype:**
- Complete AWS infrastructure deployed via CDK with all services interconnected
- Web application containers running on ECS Fargate with auto-scaling capabilities
- RDS MySQL database with multi-AZ deployment and automated backups
- ElastiCache Redis cluster providing application caching
- OpenSearch cluster handling product search functionality
- Application Load Balancer distributing traffic with health checks
- VPC network architecture with proper security group isolation
- Monitoring setup with CloudWatch metrics and basic alerting

**What is explicitly OUT OF SCOPE:**
- CI/CD pipeline implementation and DevOps automation tooling
- Advanced monitoring dashboards and comprehensive observability solutions
- Multi-region deployment and disaster recovery strategies
- Application code development or existing application migration
- Data migration tools and strategies from current systems
- Advanced security features like WAF, Shield, or compliance frameworks
- Cost optimization beyond basic right-sizing and tagging
- Integration with existing SuperMarket systems or third-party services

**Timeline & Success Criteria:**
- **Week 1 (Days 1-7)**: Complete architecture design and CDK implementation
- **Week 2 (Days 1-5)**: Prepare and deliver executive presentation with Q&A leadership
- **Success Metrics**: Functional infrastructure deployment, clear business value proposition, confident technical presentation, and professional handling of executive questions demonstrating senior-level expertise

This focused scope ensures delivery of a compelling proof-of-concept that addresses SuperMarket's core scalability and reliability challenges while demonstrating both technical implementation skills and executive communication capabilities required for senior engineering roles.
